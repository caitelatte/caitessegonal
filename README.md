# Caitessegonal - a C++ plugin for Nuke

This plugin was written as my major work for the course ARTV2619 - Digital Compositing in Semester 1 of 2014. The Visual Diary is hosted at [http://caitelartv2619.tumblr.com](caitelartv2619.tumblr.com) so you can read through my struggles, inspirations and complaints there.

Nuke is a video effects editor, and Caitessegonal is meant to work with its plugin API to create an animated tesselating animation of octagonal shapes. Mockups are available on the tumblr site linked above.
