#Caitessegonal - a C++ plugin for Nuke#

This plugin was written as my major work for the course ARTV2619 - Digital Compositing in Semester 1 of 2014. The Visual Diary is hosted at [http://caitelartv2619.tumblr.com](caitelartv2619.tumblr.com) so you can read through my struggles, inspirations and complaints there.
